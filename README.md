# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Heart-Disease-Dataset
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and risk factors. The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Descriptive statistics of patient attributes

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations

Correlation heatmaps and outlier detection

Feature engineering (e.g., age groups, cholesterol risk flags)

Insights on how factors like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and heart rate relate to heart disease occurrence

The goal is to better understand the variables that influence heart disease and provide a foundation for further predictive modeling.
